            <p class="blog-overview">Meditation can lower and regulate your heart rate and blood pressureThe
                physiological effects of meditation include a reduction in stress hormones and adrenaline, improved
                breathing and blood flow to the brain, and improved melatonin regulation. Two more benefits, a reduced
                heart rate and lower blood pressure, have encouraged doctors to increasingly recommend meditation to
                improve heart health and decrease the risk of heart disease, heart attack or stroke.How blood pressure
                variesBlood pressure is a measure of the strength of each heart beat. When we’re stressed, our body
                produces hormones which increase blood pressure. Blood vessels narrow and the heart beats faster. Stress
                hormones may contribute to arterial damage over time. In addition, when blood pressure remains high,
                risk for heart disease goes up.A resting heart rate between 60-100 beats per minute is a common
                indicator of good health. When your heart is strong and healthy, it doesn’t need to beat as often, and
                it keeps a regular pace. Like blood pressure, pulse temporarily increases in response to exertion,
                emotion, and stress.Once the trigger has subsided, a healthy heart quickly slows down again. A resting
                heart beat that remains high is correlated with heart disease and premature death.How meditation
                promotes heart healthMeditation does more than relax the mind, it has a positive physiological impact on
                our bodies. Meditation down regulates the hormonal response to stress by decreasing cortisol and
                epinephrine. In addition, meditation increases heart rate variability. HRV signals healthy heartbeat
                regulation.The following are just 3 of several studies linking meditation to heart health:Meditation &
                Heart Rate VariabilityA 2013 study by researchers at the University of Sydney in Australia found
                meditation improves HRV, a marker of physical and mental health. After spending 10 intensive days
                learning how to meditate, meditation improved the heart’s responsiveness.Meditation & Blood PressureA
                2017 study published in the International Journal of Exercise Science followed stressed college students
                through a 6-week meditation program. Throughout the 6 weeks, blood pressure and pulse decreased
                significantly from pre-meditation to post-meditation.Meditation & Heart RateThe American Journal of
                Biomedical Science and Research recently published a 2021 study on the effect of meditation on heart
                rate. As you meditation experience grows, not only does your heart beat slower with meditation, but it
                becomes more consistent. These positive results mean meditation may be beneficial in preventing heart
                disease.How to meditate to lower heart rateSome types of meditation are more effective than others at
                lowering heart rate. Meditations which focus on steady, controlled breathing are especially useful for
                bringing about a slower, more consistent heart rate.With mindfulness meditation, we can use the breath,
                the body, or the heart-beat itself as an anchor for our wandering mind. Anytime we notice the mind has
                wandered, we gently and kindly return to the anchor, without pausing to judge.</p>
